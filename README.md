      "name": "MANISH ASHOK BADKAS V/S M/S. NOVARTIS INDIA LTD. AND ANR."
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
]
```

The JSON output is indexed by `Court No.` available in the HTML file. Inside that is an array of all case objects. A case object must contain, `case` and `name`. Take care as many of the case names go into multiple lines.
